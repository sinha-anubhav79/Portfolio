**DESCRIPTION (About Project)**

My project has a landing page which has loading animations. As the logo and the header appear we can move across various pages(sections).
The about section has a brief description about me. It has a readmore button which directs you to a separate page which has additonal data.
The project section has my projects palced as flex-box cards, with an image/gif and short description about the porjects.
The skills page is the most silent and simple feature which has a list of my technical skills.
Below the skills page there is an additional skills page which has my technical designs showcased in flex-box cards. There are links that direct towards my showcased finished work in each skill- one being my YouTube channel and others being separate pages.
The Last is contact page with all my profiles linked and a photo of me.
The header always stays on the top which has the navbar and the logo. The logo is also a link that directs to the landing page.
The separated pages also have some loading animations.

**UNIQUE**

This project is totally designed by me from scratch. Each and every feature of the project is written by me from the root level - no third party help (No bootstrap, no downloaded animation style sheet, no external javascript, nothing. All are my codes).
The second thing that I'm proud about in this project is the readability of the code. It is very neat and organised. Addition and deletion of any new feature is very easy.
